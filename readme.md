# Bulma component library for Vue3

![Made with Bulma](https://img.shields.io/badge/made%20with-Bulma-00d1b2?style=roundyed-square)

## Disclaimer

This package is very much still under active development. It is not recommended to use this in production. Feel free to
help or report any issuesðŸ˜ƒ.

My attempt at creating a Vue component library using Bulma that's compatible with Vue 3, _and_ it's composition api.
I really love Bulma, and it's modern styling using CSS without JavaScript. It's definitely my bias over Bootstrap nowðŸ˜….

## Installation

`npm install bulma-vue3`

`yarn add bulma-vue3`

## Usage

```javascript
// main.js

import {createApp} from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'

// Import the library
import {default as vueBulma} from '@csc530/vue-bulma'

const app = createApp(App)
// Use the library
app.use(vueBulma)
app.mount('#app')
```

## Documentation

I highly recommend setting the `tag` prop whenever possible to reduce the amount of **non-semantic** `div` tags in your
HTML.

**Need scoped (or global) import of Bulma's CSS/SASS/... when using components.** I kept the import of the actual css
separate (*now*).

## My todo list

- [ ] make a way to pass sass vars as props to style tags

- [ ] In vite components do not load if they use vue (vue/runtime) `Component` type
  - Not sure if it's necessary as component props that'll accept HTML/Vue elements
- [ ] Add more components
- [ ] Test for backwards compatibility with Vue 2
